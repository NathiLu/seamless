- Look into the Excelsheet for a complete Overview

The .txt-files for the AmbiSpeakerPositions contains the Positions of the 45 Ambisonics-Speaker in cartesian xyz format. The unit is metre.
The file with suffix _zer175 shifts the z-Position for a zero-line of 1.75m and the file with suffix _zeroWFS shifts for the middle tweeter of the WFS-Panel array which is 2.014m.
The additional suffix _AED gives the coordinates in Azimuth [deg], Elevation[deg] and Distance [m] format with the front being 0Â°.
The WFS-file marks the beginning of the first speaker-array and the last of one panel.
